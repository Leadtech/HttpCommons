**A minimal set of definitions to work with HTTP headers and status codes.**

This package is not a framework. This is a zero dependency library and was not intended to provide any functionality unless it is specific to HTTP.

This package is for developers who need to work with headers and/or status codes and don't want an entire framework to do it.
